# express-chat

  A simple chat application using a database built on **node.js**, **Express** and **MongoDB**.
  This project has the objective of testing the scalability of the architecture **node.js + MongoDB**.
  Once the application is finished, a stress test will be run on a cluster.

  We also want to test the GridFS functionality of MongoDB.
  Thus, the application should be able to upload and share files between users of a room.


## Installation

  git clone git://github.com/Tug/express-chat.git && cd express-chat && perl init.pl
